# Semantic Chunking in RAG

This repository showcases a structured codebase using **semantic chunking** in the context of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Instead of splitting content arbitrarily, we organize and chunk information based on meaning, context, and relevance to improve the quality of retrieval and generation.

## üîç What is Semantic Chunking?

Semantic chunking means dividing content or code into **meaningful segments**, not just by size or lines. In the RAG pipeline, this ensures:

- More accurate retrieval of context-relevant documents
- Better performance in question-answering and summarization tasks
- Easier debugging, readability, and module reuse

## üß† Why Use Semantic Chunking in RAG?

Traditional RAG implementations often split documents into equal-sized chunks (e.g., 500 tokens), which can break context mid-thought. Semantic chunking keeps logical units (like paragraphs, sections, or complete ideas) together, preserving meaning and coherence.

This is crucial for:
- Long document Q&A
- Context-aware generation
- Legal, technical, or educational content retrieval
